Analyze the contract below and return ONE JSON object with EXACTLY the structure shown.

STRICT RULES:
- Return a single JSON object. NEVER wrap it in an array.
- Do not provide legal advice.
- Use null for any field where the information is not present in the contract.
- Every item in risks, deadlines, payments, obligations, and deliverables MUST include a sourceQuote copied verbatim from the contract.
- All array fields must contain objects with the exact fields listed — never plain strings.
- "changeRequestTerms" must always be a single object, never an array.
- "confidenceScore" is a number 0–100 reflecting how completely the contract covers the required fields.
